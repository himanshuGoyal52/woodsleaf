										<p>A customised product is a product that is made according to specific requirements or preferences of the customer. It is tailored to meet the unique needs of an individual or group of individuals. A customised product can be modified in terms of design, colour, size, features, or any other aspect that the customer requires. Customised products are often more expensive than standard products due to the additional time and effort involved in their production. The product which is not mentioned on our platform/website will be considered as Customised order.</p>
										<h6>Terms and Conditions for customise order :</h6>
										<ol>
											<li>The word "customised" itself specifies that the product is only manufactured/designed on behalf of the customer himself/herself. Once the order details are confirmed, at the very same time manufacturing for the product will get started, hence it cannot be cancelled and payment cannot be reversed.</li>

											<li>As customised orders are something that are not manufactured on regular basis just like other products which have fixed parameters. It can take up to 7-8 weeks of time to dispatch it from our premises. If in any other circumstances the order is getting delayed, our company customer executive will update you regarding the delay.
