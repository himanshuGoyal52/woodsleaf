                  <li><b>What if there is some issue/damage in transit?</b></li>
                  <p>All the transit related damages are totally our responsibility.</p>
                  <li><b>What are the payment options available?</b></li>

                  <li><b>How do I track my order?</b></li>
                  <p>The ideal way to track your order is to sign-up at woodsleaf.com and then visit the order tracking page. Or, as a guest, you can visit the Order Status page and your Email address or phone number linked with the order. Here, you can check the details pertaining to your order, such as Order confirmation, Manufacturing progress, Quality check and dispatch details. We always try our best to deliver the product within the specified or communicated time limit. We also proactively get in touch with the customer, either through electronic means or through calls, to notify them about the status of their product and where it is in transit. If, in a rare case, you haven’t received communication of any form from us after 10 days of placing an order, feel free to give us a call at our customer care number or drop an email at support@woodsleaf.com.</p>
                  <li><b>What is the estimated time for a delivery?</b></li>
                  <p>Once we receive the order confirmation, products are typically manufactured and dispatched within 4 - 6 weeks. We will notify you once the product has been dispatched for delivery. All the products that can be dispatched immediately are highlighted with Fast Shipping on the website. Every product is transported and delivered through our shipping partner's delivery network or our trusted third-party logistics. Although we try to make sure that the Product reaches you within the specified time of delivery, circumstances, such as transport strikes, heavy rains, floods, natural calamities, border clearance, etc., might arise which may result in a delay. In such a case, we request you to not worry. Get in touch with our Email Support Team at support@woodsleaf.com for the latest updates and information regarding your shipment, if we already haven’t been in touch with you for the same. For a fully customised product, which is being made from scratch, prototyping can result in the delivery taking more time than the standard delivery time.</p>
                  <li><b>Are there any delivery or installation charges, or any hidden fees?</b></li>
                  <p>Absolutely not. Delivery of any product is free of charge for all orders in INDIA. We deliver across India, except for a few non-serviceable PIN codes. Before placing an order, you can enter your city’s or town’s PIN code in the box provided to check whether we deliver to your area or not. In certain exceptions, however, when we do agree to deliver the Products to the non-serviceable PIN codes, we may deliver the product to You, provided that the cost of transportation/delivery and installation is borne by you in advance. Also, the product will not be covered under any warranty.</p>
                  <li><b>Will the product be exactly as shown on the Website?</b></li>
                  <p>Woodsleaf tries its best to deliver Products and Services exactly the way they are described on the Website. However, the nature and tendency of natural material-based products is that each piece of furniture is unique in its own way. Woodsleaf hereby disclaims any guarantees of exactness of the finish or appearance of the final Products or Services ordered by the User over and above generally acceptable standards on the same. The quality of the Products, Services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the Website may not meet your expectations.</p>
                  <li><b>What should I check when the product is delivered to me?</b></li>
                  <p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Please check all the external surfaces of your product for any forms of breakages, cracks, chip-offs, unfinished patches or insect infestations.</li>
                      <li>In case there is some dust deposit, or the product lacks shine, our delivery team will be able to fix this on-the-spot by applying a coat of wood polish or by rubbing the surface in question with a cloth. Please know that this is an accepted industry-standard way of cleaning the surface or polishing it.</li>
                      <li>If there is a scratch or a crack on the product, raise this issue with the delivery personnel as well as our customer support team. After that we shall re-manufacture the product/part of the product.</li>
                      <li>For all products that inform any form of assembly, please ensure that the delivery team assembles the product, so that you have the peace of mind that everything fits well and is accounted for.</li>
                      <li>For all products that require wall mounting/installation, kindly decide, prior to the delivery of the product, on the exact location in your house where you would want the product to be placed. Instruct the delivery team of the same. Please make sure that you have all the necessary approvals for drilling, etc., that may be required for mounting the products on your walls.</li>
                      <li>For all products that are kept on the floor, such as tables and chairs, ensure that the product stands stable and straight. If there happens to be an uneven leg (having less than 5mm of difference), then please manually install the bushes sent within the box. If the difference of the uneven leg is more than 5mm, we will take the item back and provide a replacement or a repair, based on the extent of the change required.</li>
                      <li>For all forms of seating products, such as sofas, kindly sit on the product to ensure that the whole structure is stable with your weight on it. Also check the fabrics for any deformities or defects.</li>
                      <li>We make sure that the insides of storage products, such as drawers, are well-finished so as to not have any splinters or loose pieces that might hurt your arms. However, the extent of polish in these internal areas may not match with the extent of polish on the external areas.</li>
                      <li>Wood, especially hardwoods, have natural physical aspects, such as differing grain patterns and minimal stain differences. No knots will be present in your product, as these result in structural weakness, and are rejected at the quality control stage. Differing grain patterns and stain differences are generally acceptable on hardwood products.</li>
                      <li>During the summer months, hardwood products may expand slightly, which might result in some drawers to get stuck. This is completely normal, and you need not worry about it. Minimize the exposure of the product to heat, and when Summer passes, it will return back to the previous form.</li>
